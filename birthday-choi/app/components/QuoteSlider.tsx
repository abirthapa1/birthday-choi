It is one of the best things I could have witnessed, it's a shame you abandoned the little game but you had a lot of potential. Changing the subject, it's your birthday and I want to tell you that you deserve everything and more, you are a great person and don't let anyone tell you otherwise, remember that everything can be achieved with effort and dedication and you, you have plenty. Happy Birthday :3",
